# Weather-Forecast-App

## Description

- The motivation for this project was to be able to see a weather forecast for any city.
- I built this app to accurately see weather forecasts for any city.
- What problem does it solve? This app solves the problem of not knowing what the weather will be in any city.
- I learned how to use apis better and learned how to set up functions better within javascript.


## Usage
